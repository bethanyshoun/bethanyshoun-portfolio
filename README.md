# Create a Professional Portfolio

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create a professional portfolio website from scratch. Requirements included information about the developer (me), a recent photo, working internal links, images of the developer's web applications that link to that deployed application, and a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport on various screens and devices. 

Initial steps required included creating the needed html, css, and README files with proper conventions and subfolders; creating a GitHub repository and cloning it to my computer; and establishing the local files as a git repository that pushes to the appropriate GitHub repository.

Next I created a wireframe for the site in Google Slides and used to to do the inital layout the HTML framework. It required several adjustments once I got started entering the code in HTML. I looked at former lessons and working class assignments to remind myself what was needed for the various divs required. 

I found royalty-free stock photos for my project photo placeholders. I also created placeholder links (to the top of my page) for those images until I have deployed projects and can add those external links to the website.

I added my email address and the link to open a mailto: window. I also added the external link for my GitHub site. I used target="_blank" to open the link in a new tab.

Then I began the CSS file, again referencing MDN, W3Schools, and previous projects to check styling conventions. This was the most challenging aspect of the project for me. It required a lot of fiddling and looking at other deployed applications in Developer Tools to see how the structure worked compared to how I wanted my application to function. 

I spent a lot of time experimenting and making adjustments, testing different div structures and classes in html, and various ways to make flexbox look the way I wanted in the projects section. I continued to tweak flexbox, add CSS attributes to all of the sections of my site, and update HTML as needed throughout the process.

I was able to format the header with navigation- and the footer in CSS relatively quickly using previous work as a guide. The Media Queries also went more quickly than I anticipated with the help of Developer Tools and comparing the changes made to some similar attributes in the Run Buddy project. 

My final steps were to outline and fill in the README file and add the needed sections to deploy my first from-scratch website.

For my first group project we created a web application called Cat Genie. I updated the placeholder image and link for project 1 to reflect this project. I opened the link in a blank tab by setting the target to _blank.
